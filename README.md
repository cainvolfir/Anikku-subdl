# Aniyomi â€” Wyzie Subtitle Downloader Button

A simple **Aniyomi custom button** (Lua) that automatically searches and downloads subtitles (SRT or other formats) from the Wyzie subtitle API using `curl` (installed using termux).

---

## What this custom-button does

This custom-button can do searching and downloading subtitle automatically using Wyzie API for your current-watching entry in Aniyomi

---

## Quick install & usage (concise step-by-step)

1. Install [Termux](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux) (Fâ€‘Droid link).

2. Open Termux and update packages, then install `curl`:

```bash
pkg update && pkg upgrade -y
pkg install curl -y
```

3. In Android settings grant Aniyomi full file access (Setting â†’ Permission â†’ Storage access/Manage all files) so the script can save subtitle files to your chosen folder.

4. Open Aniyomi â†’ **Settings â†’ Player â†’ Custom Buttons** â†’ **Add custom button**.

5. Copy-paste code from this repo into the matching fields:

   * **On tap**: paste the code inside `On_tap.lua` file in custom button 'Lua code' field . Edit the `CONFIG` section at the top (language, download dir, TMDb API key, etc.) as you need.
   * **On long-press**: paste the code inside `On_long.lua` file in custom button 'Lua code (long-press)' field.

6. Open any episode or movie and wait for the video to load. Tap the custom button:

   * The script detects the title, season, and episode (if any), then using TMDb API key to search the TMDb ID by title, after TMDb ID found, it converts that to an IMDb ID, then queries Wyzie and downloads matching subtitles.

7. In Aniyomi, add the downloaded `.srt` as an external subtitle (Player â†’ Add external subtitle) and pick the file from your download folder.

8. Long-press the button to remove subtitle files from the download directory (the loaded subtitle stays active in memory).

---

## Suggested workflow (recommended)

1. Tap to download all available subtitles for the current entry.
2. Load some `.srt` and check the subtitle timing/translation.
3. If it's already matches, long-press to clear the download folder and free space â€” the currently loaded subtitle remains in the player.

## Configuration (`CONFIG` table)

Edit the `CONFIG` table at the top of `On_tap.lua`. Important keys:

* `LANG` â€” language code (e.g. `"id"` for Indonesian, `"en"` for English).
* `FORMAT` â€” subtitle format (default: `"srt"`).
* `DOWNLOAD_DIR` â€” save location (example: `"/sdcard/Download/"`).
* `SOURCE` â€” Wyzie `source` query (use `"all"` to aggregate sources).
* `ENCODING` â€” optional (e.g. `"utf-8"`).
* `CURL_TIMEOUT`, `SLEEP_LOG`, `OVERWRITE`, `DEBUG_SHOW_RESPONSE_SNIPPET` â€” advanced/debug options.
* **TMDB\_API\_KEY** â€” *required* for titleâ†’TMDbâ†’IMDb lookup. Get a key by signing up on TMDb and copying your API key into the `CONFIG` table.

## How to get a TMDb API key
1. Go to [TMDb](https://themoviedb.org)
2. Sign Up/Login
3. Find the API section in your settings.
4. Click Request API Key.
5. Copy your key and paste it in TMDB_API_KEY.

## Why use IMDb ID instead of TMDb? ðŸŽ¥
The script uses IMDb ID because IMDb is very well-known everywhere, much wider than TMDb. Even though Wyzie API support using TMDb ID but there's some movie/shows that doesn't get recognized by Wyzie API despite the correct TMDb ID. That's why IMDb ID is better to use.

## Troubleshooting (quick fixes)

* **"Curl test failed"** â€” make sure `curl` is installed in Termux and the device has network access. Test: `curl https://sub.wyzie.ru` in Termux.
* **No subtitles found** but you expect some:

  * Try `SOURCE = "all"` in the `CONFIG` table.
  * If subtitle characters look wrong, try `ENCODING = "utf-8"`.
  * Set `DEBUG_SHOW_RESPONSE_SNIPPET = true` to view a short API response for debugging.
* **Permissions errors** â€” ensure Aniyomi has storage permission and Termux has network access.

If none of the above helps, open `On_tap.lua`, enable debug, and copy the response snippet to an issue or message for help.
